# Go init()

```
the init() function is a special function that is automatically executed when a package is initialized. Each source file can define its own init() function, and they are run in the order in which the files are compiled. The init() function is useful for setting up package-level variables, initializing resources, or performing other setup tasks before the rest of the code is executed.
